# hw_jpeg
 
The programs require GNU gcc compiler

1. On the prompt of Windows OS 11, run t.bat.

2. type test "image.jpg" on the prompt.

The output bitmap file: bitmapImage.bmp

We finished and solved the following problems:
1. entropy decode
2. dequantization
3. correctly generate RGB values of 8x8 blocks

We try our best and spend much time on debugging to write the JPEG decoder, but the program still cannot output the correct bitmap image.

We upload the programs to github:
